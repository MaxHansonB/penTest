This application is used to generate randomized attack graphs for a 
simple pentesting planning algorithm. Running main.py will generate new 
PDDL problems (according to your desired specifications). The created files 
will show up in the pddl_folder (though all the main cases I looked at are 
already pre-generated for you).

The PDDL plan (pentest.pddl) can also be found in pddl_folder.

I use one custom github library, sorobn, for Bayes net visualization. 
To download it, you'll have to run:

pip install git+https://github.com/MaxHalford/sorobn
