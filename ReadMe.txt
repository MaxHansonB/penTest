PDDL domain file and problem files can be found in the pddl_files folder.

If you set up a project using the PenTest folder as the main directory,
you can run main.py to generate new PDDL problems (according to your
desired specifications at the bottom of main.py).  The created files
will show up in the pddl_folder (though all the main cases I looked at
are already pre-generated for you).

I've included a requirements.txt file. But I also used one custom
github library, sorobn, for Bayes net visualization. To download it
You'll have to run:

pip install git+https://github.com/MaxHalford/sorobn

Finally, the deep learning models can be found in the GoogleColab (with output
included). If you want to re-run stuff, you'll need the BODMAS dataset, which
I've also included. Just stick it in your GoogleDrive and change the PATH in
the Colab file.

When running the colab file, run it start to finish to avoid errors. Some of
the variable names get reused in the second experiment, so jumping around can
cause problems.
